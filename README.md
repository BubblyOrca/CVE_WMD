Security, Risk, Compliance, Efficiency, Automation, and Performance

### üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability-Focused Applications (Security, Risk, Compliance)

| Application Area                    | Application                                                               | Data Science Techniques to Practice                        |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Patch Failure Prediction           | Identify endpoints likely to fail patching and prioritize remediation.                      | Predictive modeling, classification algorithms             |
| Vulnerability Scoring / Prioritization | Rank vulnerabilities by severity, exploitability, and asset value.                        | Risk scoring models, clustering, anomaly detection         |
| Exploit Pattern Detection          | Spot unusual behavior or patch gaps that align with known exploits.                         | Sequence modeling, anomaly detection, time-series analysis |
| Endpoint Risk Assessment           | Score endpoints based on configuration drift, missing patches, or outdated software.        | Risk modeling, ensemble learning                           |
| Threat Intelligence Integration    | Ingest CVE reports, vendor advisories, and threat feeds to enhance decision-making.         | NLP, graph analysis, entity linking                        |
| Predictive Compliance Monitoring   | Predict systems likely to fall out of compliance with patch policies or SLAs.               | Forecasting, rules-based classification                    |
| Security Alert Prioritization     | Filter false positives and prioritize security alerts based on contextual risk.             | Supervised learning, anomaly detection                     |
